Hello, I am Arun.

I am a Software Development Engineer, and I love data, which gives me the nice hat of a Data Engineer.

My current area of expertise is Data Processing, Big Data, SQL and Functional Programming.

I started coding back in high school and have since maintained a deep interest in coding and now I engineer data products.
