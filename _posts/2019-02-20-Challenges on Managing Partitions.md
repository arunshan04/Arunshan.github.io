In this post I try to talk about my experience of building a (Big) Data Lake on the AWS Cloud using S3 as a data store, and solutions to common problems that we faced.

I had worked with Philips Health Tech to build the data lake, however most of the problems we faced are universal and can be applied to almost any large scale  data engineering product built these days.
